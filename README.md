# Online-paint-app
An online paint app with the ability to preview and download drawings as images.

This is an online paint app created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The HTML contains a canvas element on which the user can draw by clicking and holding the mouse and moving it in any direction.
Below the image are three buttons and two input fields.
The first button allows the user to save a preview of the drawing in the form of an image.
The second button is disabled at the start. When the user saves a preview of the image the button becomes enabled and allows the user to download the drawing in .png format.
The third button is used for clearing the canvas. When the user clicks on it for the first time, the user will be asked to confirm if they want to clear the canvas.
The first input field is used to select the pen color.
The second input field is used to select the pen width.
